Why have the reading habits of teenagers dropped so much ? Maybe due to laziness or a lack of wanting to be cultured ? What if the problem was much deeper than it seemed. After much research, I have concluded that middle schools are the source of the problem most of the time.

Teenagers in middle school get told to read a book which they will be questioned about later during a test. Students don’t get to choose a book and they surely aren’t encouraged to read the book they are given.

Bibliomania’s solution to this problem is to propose a space for positive discussion around books via an app. Students join a classroom created by their teacher and  get the opportunity to vote for the next book they will collectively read. After having read the book, students take a little quiz with some questions that require deeper thinking. Students can also discuss each book in its own forum/chat. A classroom uses the app to further discuss books in class.

Bibliomania is the very first mobile app I was able to create. After expanding my knowledge of React during the first semester of my last year at EhB, I ultimately decided to take the challenge and create a React Native mobile application for my Final Work. All this led to the creation of Bibliomania.
